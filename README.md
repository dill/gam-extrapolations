Extrapolations in Generalized Additive Models
==============================================


To think about:

- What are "good" qualities for an extrapolation?
  - flare out CIs
  - sensible (flat?) mean effects
- Why are Duchon splines/order 1 penalties bad?
- How can we get around this?

  * `extrap.md` outline of a paper
  * `1d_extrapolation_code.R` code fom EJP to look at various 1-D approaches to extrapolation
  * `2d_extrapolation_code.R` DLM's code for 2-D approaches (warning, uses `rgl`)
