# Abstract

We review the mean and uncertainty properties of current, commonly-used, smoothers when they are used to extrapolate beyond the range of the data and suggest some properties that are desirable (at least when modelling the distributions of biological populations from survey data). We then go on to suggest some modifications of the current methods that provide our desirable properties.



# Intro


# Commonly-used smoothers and their extrapolative properties

Split by 1-d and 2-d?

## Thin plate regression splines

* `m=1`
* `m=2`

## Duchon splines




# Desirable properties for extrapolation


# Some solutions


# Conclusion
