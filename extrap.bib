	abstract = {Conventional smoothing methods sometimes perform badly when used to smooth data over complex domains, by smoothing inappropriately across boundary features, such as peninsulas. Solutions to this smoothing problem tend to be computationally complex, and not to provide model smooth functions which are appropriate for incorporating as components of other models, such as generalized additive models, or mixed additive models. In this paper we propose a class of smoothers appropriate for smoothing over difficult regions of R2, which can be represented in terms of a low rank basis and one or two quadratic penalties. The key features of these smoothers are (i) that they do not {\textquoteleft}smooth across{\textquoteright} boundary features; (ii) that their representation in terms of a basis and penalties allows straightforward incorporation as components of GAMs, mixed models and other non-standard models; (iii) that smoothness selection for these model components is straightforward to accomplish in a computationally efficient manner via GCV, AIC or REML, for example; (iv) that their low rank means that their use is computationally efficient.},

	abstract = {The (modified) Newton method is adapted to optimize generalized cross validation (GCV) and generalized maximum likelihood (GML) scores with multiple smoothing parameters. The main concerns in solving the optimization problem are the speed and the reliability of the algorithm, as well as the invariance of the algorithm under transformations under which the problem itself is invariant. The proposed algorithm is believed to be highly efficient for the problem, though it is still rather expensive for large data sets, since its operational counts are (2/3)kn + O(n2), with k the number of smoothing parameters and n the number of observations. Sensible procedures for computing good starting values are also proposed, which should help in keeping the execution load to the minimum possible. The algorithm is implemented in Rkpack [RKPACK and its applications: Fitting smoothing spline models, Tech. Report 857, Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, 1989] and illustrated by examples of fitting additive and interaction spline models. It is noted that the algorithm can also be applied to the maximum likelihood (ML) and the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation of the variance component models.},

	abstract = {The P-splines of Eilers and Marx (Stat Sci 11:89{\textendash}121, 1996) combine a B-spline basis with a discrete quadratic penalty on the basis coefficients, to produce a reduced rank spline like smoother. P-splines have three properties that make them very popular as reduced rank smoothers: (i) the basis and the penalty are sparse, enabling efficient computation, especially for Bayesian stochastic simulation; (ii) it is possible to flexibly {\textquoteleft}mix-and-match{\textquoteright} the order of B-spline basis and penalty, rather than the order of penalty controlling the order of the basis as in spline smoothing; (iii) it is very easy to set up the B-spline basis functions and penalties. The discrete penalties are somewhat less interpretable in terms of function shape than the traditional derivative based spline penalties, but tend towards penalties proportional to traditional spline penalties in the limit of large basis size. However part of the point of P-splines is not to use a large basis size. In addition the spline basis functions arise from solving functional optimization problems involving derivative based penalties, so moving to discrete penalties for smoothing may not always be desirable. The purpose of this note is to point out that the three properties of basis-penalty sparsity, mix-and-match penalization and ease of setup are readily obtainable with B-splines subject to derivative based penalization. The penalty setup typically requires a few lines of code, rather than the two lines typically required for P-splines, but this one off disadvantage seems to be the only one associated with using derivative based penalties. As an example application, it is shown how basis-penalty sparsity enables efficient computation with tensor product smoothers of scattered data.},

They rely on a proper understanding of how environmental drivers determine species occurrence patterns. This understanding is usually derived from an analysis of the species{\textquoteright} present distribution by statistical means (species distribution models). Projections based on species distribution models make several assumptions (such as constancy of limiting factors, no evolutionary adaptation to drivers, global dispersal), some of which are ecologically untenable. Also, methodological issues muddy the waters (e.g. spatial autocorrelation, collinearity of drivers). Here, I review the main shortcomings of species distribution models and species distribution projections, identify limits to their use and open a perspective on how to overcome some current obstacles. As a consequence, I caution biogeographers against making projections too lightheartedly and conservation ecologists and policy makers to be aware that there are several unresolved problems.},
